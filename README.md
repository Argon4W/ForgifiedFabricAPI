### Some things might still not work yet

- Production
- Publishing
- CI

### Why

- MOJMAP!
  - By using mojmap, we eliminate any necessary remapping, leading to greatly shorter build times and improved development
    time efficiency
  - Improved stability: we no longer need to rely on archloom's "hopes" and "prayers" for neo loom support
  - Improved dev experience: no more userdev remapping issues
- Syncing with upstream is (hopefully) made easier via automation scripts

### Running the root project

- Make sure your IDEA Gradle settings are set to "Build and run using IntelliJ IDEA"
- Use the IDE run to launch the game

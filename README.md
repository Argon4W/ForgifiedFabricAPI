### Some things might still not work yet

- Running the root project
- Production
- Publishing
- CI

### Why

- MOJMAP!
  - By using mojmap, we eliminate any necessary remapping, leading to greatly shorter build times and improved development
    time efficiency
  - Improved stability: we no longer need to rely on archloom's "hopes" and "prayers" for neo loom support
  - Improved dev experience: no more userdev remapping issues
- Syncing with upstream is (hopefully) made easier via automation scripts
